## Project Website
This started as the final project in one of my web dev courses. All that was expected of us was a simple HTML page with links (think early 2000's website). Over the winter I completely overhauled it and ended up learning how much more work web development took than I had thought. A link can be found [here] (krishanhewitt.ca).

## Credits
Drawing app was created by following this [Sketchpad Tutorial] and adding some other features of my own (https://zipso.net/a-simple-touchscreen-sketchpad-using-javascript-and-html5/)  

The NavBar, BootStrap features, AJAX demos, and other features used certain aspects from [W3 Schools Tutorials] (https://www.w3schools.com/)
